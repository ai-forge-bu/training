## Scope Management

If you're running behind schedule, prioritize:

### Must Have (Core)
- [ ] Main functionality working
- [ ] Basic data input/output
- [ ] Critical validation

### Should Have (Important)
- [ ] Data persistence
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Basic styling

### Nice to Have (Optional)
- [ ] Advanced features
- [ ] Animations
- [ ] Perfect design
- [ ] Extra polish

**If short on time, cut "Nice to Have" features. A working simple app is better than a broken complex one.**

---

## Daily Check-in with PIC

### End of Day 2
Message your PIC with:
- What you accomplished
- What you're working on next
- Any blockers or concerns

### End of Day 3
Message your PIC with:
- Current status
- Whether you're ready for deployment
- Any last-minute issues

---

## Red Flags (Stop and Ask for Help)

### Stop and ask if:
- [ ] Stuck on the same issue for 30+ minutes
- [ ] Made no progress in half a day
- [ ] Features are breaking other features
- [ ] Constantly rewriting the same code
- [ ] Feeling completely overwhelmed
- [ ] Not sure if project is on track

**Don't wait until it's too late - ask early!**

---

## Success Metrics Check

Review the success metrics you defined in spec.md:

- [ ] Metric 1: [Your metric]
- [ ] Metric 2: [Your metric]
- [ ] Metric 3: [Your metric]

Can your app meet these metrics? If not, adjust scope or features.

---

## Motivation Checklist

Remember:

- [ ] Progress over perfection
- [ ] Working simple beats broken complex
- [ ] Every bug fixed is a lesson learned
- [ ] Your PIC is here to help
- [ ] You're building something real
- [ ] It doesn't have to be perfect
- [ ] Celebrate small wins

---

## End of Day 3: Final Status

Rate yourself on each:

**Functionality (Core features work)**
- [ ] Not ready
- [ ] Partially ready
- [ ] Fully ready

**Deployment Ready (Can push to GitHub)**
- [ ] Not ready
- [ ] Partially ready
- [ ] Fully ready

**Confidence Level**
- [ ] Need help
- [ ] Somewhat confident
- [ ] Very confident

**If "Not ready" on any: Talk to your PIC immediately!**
