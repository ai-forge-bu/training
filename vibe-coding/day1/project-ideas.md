# Sample Project Ideas

Project ideas suitable for the training, organized by difficulty and use case. All projects should be achievable in 2-3 days by non-technical participants using AI code assistants.

---

## ‚úÖ Selection Criteria

Good projects for this training should:
- Solve a real pain point you have
- Be achievable in 2-3 days
- Work as a standalone app (no integration with company products)
- Be deployable to Netlify/Vercel
- Have clear success metrics

## Important: You Don't Need to Know Technology!

**Don't worry about HOW to build it.** Focus on WHAT you want to build.

When you start building, ask the AI:
```
I want to build [your project idea].
I'm a complete beginner. What technology should I use?
Please keep it simple and help me get started.
```

The AI will recommend the right technology for your project and help you set everything up.

## üí° How to Choose Your Project

Ask yourself:

1. **Does this solve a real problem I have?**
   - If yes, you'll be motivated to finish it
   - If no, pick something else

2. **Can I clearly define success?**
   - "I'll use this 10 times" is good
   - "It should be nice" is too vague

3. **Is it achievable in 2-3 days?**
   - Start with simpler version
   - You can always add features later

4. **Do I understand what it should do?**
   - If you can't describe it, you can't build it
   - Write your spec.md first!

### Step 3: Choose (2 minutes)
Pick the one with the best combined score.

### Step 4: Define (15 minutes)
Write your spec.md using the template provided.

- Mobile apps (stick to web for easier deployment)
- Projects with unclear success criteria

**Remember:** Start simple, make it work, then enhance if time allows!
