# Vibe Coding Training

Welcome to the Vibe Coding Training! This 4-day program teaches non-technical employees how to build custom software solutions using AI code assistants.

## What is Vibe Coding?

"Vibe coding" is building software with the help of AI code assistants like Google Gemini, Claude, or ChatGPT. Instead of writing every line of code manually, you guide the AI with clear instructions to build what you need.

## Training Overview

- **Dates:** October 13-16, 2025
- **Location:** Ajobthing Kuala Lumpur Office

## Training Structure

### Day 1: Introduction (2-hour class)
- Setting up tools (VS Code, Google Gemini CLI)
- Learning AI-assisted coding basics
- Writing project specifications
- Choosing your project

### Day 2-3: Building (Independent work with PIC support)
- Build your project using AI assistance
- Get help from your assigned PIC (Person In Charge)
- Test and refine your solution

### Day 4: Deployment (2-hour class)
- Learn GitHub basics
- Deploy your project to Netlify or Vercel
- Make your solution accessible to everyone

## Training Goals

By the end of this training, you will:
1. Be comfortable using AI to build custom solutions
2. Have confidence to start "vibe coding" on your own
3. Have deployed a working project that solves a real problem

## Your PICs (Persons In Charge)

Participants are divided into three groups:
- **Group 1:** Nanda
- **Group 2:** Nathania
- **Group 3:** Desi

Your PIC is your go-to person for questions, guidance, and support during Day 2-3.

## Tools Used

All tools are free:
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code
- **AI Assistant:** Google Gemini CLI
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
- **Deployment:** Netlify or Vercel

## Project Requirements

Your project must:
- Solve a real problem or pain point you have
- Be achievable in 2-3 days
- Be fully isolated (no integration with company products)
- Be deployable to Netlify or Vercel
- Have clear success metrics

See [`SPEC.md`](./SPEC.md) for complete project scope requirements.
